# Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies
## Module 18 Machine Learning Challenge

## Overview of Cryptocurrencies:

Martha and I have completed some initial research on using the tools for Unsupervisede Machine Learning.
I have now gained a better understanding of:
* what unsupervised learning is used for, 
* how to process data, 
* how to cluster, 
* how to reduce your dimensions, and 
* how to reduce the principal components using PCA 

I used these above listed skills to create an analysis for my clients who are looking to invest in the cryptocurrency market.

Martha is a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting. This is a tier one client for you,
so you want to ensure your research is accurate and well documented with data output in the form of dataframes as
well as visualizations. Because Accountability Accounting is a well know and prominent investment bank, is interested
 in offering a  cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its clients. Your report will include which cryptocurrencies are on the 
trading market and how they could be clustered to create a classification system for this type of investment.
As the data is not in a clear format, it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning
models. Martha and I have determined that the use of unsupervised learning is the best method for this type of data.
